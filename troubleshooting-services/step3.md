Your continued success at solving Kubernetes problems has earned you a
promotion. You're now the team leader at your company. The go-to person for the
advanced Kubernetes problems.

One of your teammates asks you for help with solving a problem with one of the
development clusters. Your teammate explains that none of the applications
deployed within the cluster are accessible. These applications have been tested
using the same YAML manifests on other clusters and have been found to work just
fine.

As you sit down at the keyboard to begin troubleshooting, you keep in mind that
your co-worker knows basic Kubernetes troubleshooting and the usual suspects
have probably been checked. Based on the fact that the same manifests work in
other clusters, you suspect a configuration issue with the cluster yourself.
